# canvas-fireworks

A small HTML5 `<canvas>` project that simulates fireworks shooting into the air and exploding. Just a fun little coding challenge written in pure JavaScript with no frameworks.
  
## Try It
Open `index.html` in your browser.  

## How It Works
- Particles rise from random spots along the bottom of the canvas at varying speeds.
- They eventually explode and burst into more particles.  
- A transparent background fill creates the firework trail effect.
